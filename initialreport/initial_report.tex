\section{Main Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication through password/certificates
\item Access levels
\item Write ahead
\item Election of master peer (which owns the valid database at any moment)
\item On wake up database update through RMI to the master peer
\item Synchronization
\item Name resolution in order to the access level
\end{itemize}

\section{TargetPlatforms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java standalone application for PC/UNIX
\item Java standalone application for Android (if time permits)
\end{itemize}
 
\section{Additional Services and Improvements (if time permits)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Server for access outside of Company through TCP API (just a bridge)
\item Mobile application to get and backup files through Android
\end{itemize}
